# The DLRS (Declarative Lookup Rollup Summaries) tool

## Use cases

* Can't use native rollup summaries.
* Job needs to be done by an administrator.

## Considerations

The tool has gone through a big migration in the past. It used to use custom settings for managing rollups, but since Salesforce introduced Custom Metadata Types, the tool uses them.

## Repository

The source code can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/afawcett/declarative-lookup-rollup-summaries/).
