## About this site

This is an open-source website with the goal to aggregate Salesforce resources such as open source projects (like the DLRS or the Mass Action Scheduler) and comment about them, talk about their use cases, but mostly because the creator had too much free time on a weekend.

You can check out the source code at the github repository in the link above. This website is hosted at GitHub as well. It's source is generated by a Python script that gathers the sources from many folders and "compiles" them to HTML which is then served by GitHub. The script is also custom made too (which is why it might look a little too ugly - *PR's are welcome*).

### Contributing

This website's source is open [on GitHub](https://github.com/Dogeforce/dogeforce.github.io/), so anyone with Python 3.8+ installed can contribute (because it is necessary to generate the files locally and push them). Just create a pull request with the content or improvements to the site's (like the CSS). The project uses [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to manage dependencies, so one can easily create a virtual Python environment to use the libraries (the four packages listed on the Pipfile).

To write an article, create the markdown file inside the `content > source > posts` folder, and do not forget to add the metadata information on the beginning of the file, such as:

    ---
    title: The title of the article
    author: your @ on github or maybe twitter (or none)
    publish_date: 2020-12-25
    preview: A small text explaining what the article is about
    ---

Then you can use the `make build` command to generate the necessary files. The script reads the files inside the `content > source > posts` folder and turns them into `.html` files on the `posts` folder. Alternatively, if there is no `make` command available one just needs to run the `src/scripts/main.py` file with `python` from the root folder.

It is possible to preview the content using `make serve` to start a simple http server on the folder, so one is able to access a site version locally.

### The Doge logo

This amazing image was made by a member of the Salesforce Discord Exchange (SFXD). Even stickers were made of it:
