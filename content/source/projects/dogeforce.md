## About this site

This is an open-source website with the goal to aggregate Salesforce resources such as open source projects (like the DLRS or the Mass Action Scheduler) and comment about them, talk about their use cases, but mostly because the creator had too much free time on a weekend.

You can check out the source code at the github repository in the link above. This website is hosted at GitHub as well. It's source is generated by a Python script that gathers the sources from many folders and "compiles" them to HTML which is then served by GitHub. The script is also custom made too (which is why it might look a little too ugly - *PR's are welcome*).

### The Doge logo

This amazing image was made by a member of the Salesforce Discord Exchange (SFXD). Even stickers were made of it:
