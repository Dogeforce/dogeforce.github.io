## A quote from the project itself:

>Mass Action Scheduler is a free-as-in-speech and open source developed passion project of Doug Ayers.

And its goal is to give administrators the power to use Batch Apex's power, which is mostly in the hands of developers.

With this tool an administrator can declaratively schedule a series of process automations (such as email alerts, workflow rules and flows).
