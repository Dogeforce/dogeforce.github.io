    <h1>The DLRS (Declarative Lookup Rollup Summaries) tool</h1>

<h2>Use cases</h2>

<ul>
<li>Can't use native rollup summaries.</li>
<li>Job needs to be done by an administrator.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Considerations</h2>

<p>The tool has gone through a big migration in the past. It used to use custom settings for managing rollups, but since Salesforce introduced Custom Metadata Types, the tool uses them.</p>

<h2>Repository</h2>

<p>The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/afawcett/declarative-lookup-rollup-summaries/">on GitHub</a>.</p>
